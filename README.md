The Blocks Problem
Many areas of Computer Science use simple, abstract domains for both analytical and empirical studies.
For example, an early AI study of planning and robotics (STRIPS) used a block world in which a robot
arm performed tasks involving the manipulation of blocks.
In this problem you will model a simple block world under certain rules and constraints. Rather
than determine how to achieve a specified state, you will “program” a robotic arm to respond to a
limited set of commands.
